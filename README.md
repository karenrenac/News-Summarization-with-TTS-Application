# News Summarization and Sentiment Analysis Application

## Overview

This application performs news summarization, sentiment analysis, comparative analysis, and generates Hindi audio summaries using text-to-speech. Users can input a company name and receive a structured sentiment report, along with a playable audio output in Hindi.

The solution is designed as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate end-to-end software development involving web scraping, NLP, API design, and deployment.

## Features

- Extract news articles related to a given company using Bing RSS feeds.
- Summarize each article using LexRank extractive summarization.
- Perform sentiment analysis using a transformer-based RoBERTa model.
- Conduct comparative sentiment and topic analysis across articles.
- Generate a Hindi audio summary using gTTS.
- Expose APIs via FastAPI for frontend-backend interaction.
- Simple frontend interface using Streamlit.
- Deployable via Docker or on Hugging Face Spaces.


## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the project:
1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/karenrenac/News-Summarization-with-TTS-Application.git
cd News-Summarization-with-TTS-Application
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Backend API (FastAPI):
```
uvicorn api:app --reload
```
Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to view the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).
4. Run the Frontend (Streamlit):
```
streamlit run app.py
```

### Running with Docker (Optional)
1. Build Docker Image
```
docker build -t news-summarizer .
```
2. Run Docker Container
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 news-summarizer
```

## Models and Tools Used
* Summarization: LexRank algorithm via sumy library.
* Sentiment Analysis: cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest transformer model using HuggingFace transformers.
* Text-to-Speech (TTS): Hindi audio generated using gTTS.
* Topic Analysis: Extracted using keyword filtering and Sentence-BERT embeddings.
* Web Scraping: RSS feed parsing using feedparser and BeautifulSoup.

## API Details
The backend is developed using FastAPI and exposes endpoints to:

* Accept a company name as input
* Return structured JSON output with article titles, summaries, sentiment scores, comparative analysis, and topic overlaps
* Generate Hindi audio summary

Endpoints are documented at /docs via Swagger UI.

## Assumptions & Limitations
* News sources are limited to Bing RSS for simplicity and compatibility.
* Summarization is extractive, not abstractive.
* Hindi audio generation is a basic implementation using gTTS and can be enhanced using advanced open-source models.
* The application is optimized for demonstrative purposes and may require scaling strategies for production deployment.
